This is a MERN APP that is using react on front end and a REST API using node js and mongodb on the backend without express 

In this app you can:
- Create an account 
- Login
- Write Messages

and it was difficult without 3rd party frameworks/libraries due to routings and parsing data and CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing ) issues

But I couldm't make (Edit and delete Messages and add replys) due to the difficulty of CORS issues and  adding relations in the data base
without a 3rd party frameworks/libraries and lack of time 

In the end I learned a lot from this experience;
